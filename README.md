# RPN Calculator with Tkinter UI

##ã€€Introduction
This project is a calculator application that supports Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). It includes a command-line interface for direct RPN conversion and evaluation, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations and is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient calculating experience.

## Features
RPN Conversion: Convert standard arithmetic expressions into Reverse Polish Notation.
Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
Tkinter GUI: A simple and user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction.
Unit Tests: Comprehensive unit tests ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the calculator's core functionalities.

## Installation
